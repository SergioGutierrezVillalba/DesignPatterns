# Prototype Pattern

This folder contains a very clear and short example of a Prototype Pattern written in Java.

## What is a Prototype?

Create any kind of objects using a prototypical instance. In order to avoid hierachy and the use of 'new', 
reducing the number of classes needed to implement objects, a Prototype clones an existing instantiation. 

The prototype design pattern solves problems like:

* How can a system be independent of how its products are created, composed or represented?
* How can a program avoid the use of class hierachy and factories to implement objects?
* How can be implemented an addition/deletion of objects at run-time?

In this repo you have a typical usecase of the Prototype Pattern, where you want to create a variety of books with any kind of topic. Limitless creation of more topics required. Prototype allows the cloning of any book, attaching whatever topic to it.
