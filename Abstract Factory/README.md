# Abstract Factory Pattern

This folder contains an example of an Abstract Factory Method Pattern written in Java.

## What is an Abstract Factory?

In software engineering, the Abstract Factory pattern is a software design pattern that allows an application to decouple the composition, representation and implementation of its products.

The Abstract factory method design pattern solves problems like:

* How can a program decouple all its logic from its concrete implementation?
* Which is the way to avoid code duplication in a frequent composition or creation of the most used objects?
* How can the responsability and the logic being delegate to helper subclasses?

In this repo you have a typical usecase of the Abstract Factory Pattern, where you want to create a system that is going to work with any type of subsystem that we can add at any moment. Doesn't matter which type of representation or creation we use, the application is going to deal with it without any problem thanks to the Abstract Factory. Once modularized, we can rely on the scalabilty of the code.
