# Singleton Pattern

This folder contains a very clear and short example of a Singleton Pattern written in Java.

## What is a Singleton?

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that ensures that a class only
has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

The singleton design pattern solves problems like:

* How can it be ensured that a class has only one instance?
* How can the sole instance of a class be accessed easily?
* How can a class control its instantiation?
* How can the number of instances of a class be restricted?

The singleton design pattern describes how to solve such problems:

* Hide the constructor of the class.
* Define a public static operation (getInstance()) that returns the sole instance of the class.

In this repo you have a typical usecase of the Singleton Pattern, ensure that you only have a unique Database instance and you are not creating multiple Database object with their own connections that remain after your code finishes its tasks.
