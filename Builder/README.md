# Builder Pattern

This folder contains an example of a Builder Pattern written in Java.

## What is a Builder?

In software engineering, the Builder pattern is a software design pattern that allows an application to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.

The builder method design pattern solves problems like:

* Which is the way to avoid coupling between the creation of a complex object and its representation?
* Which is the best way to allow multiple representations of the same object?

In this repo you have a usecase of the Builder Pattern, where you want to represent a decimal number in an unknown (endless) number of formats. Builder pattern will make available the achieving of that goal in a scalable and sustainable way.
